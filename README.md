Personal Information
Full Name: Safianu Sani Mohammed
Age: 20
Stack: Mobile Developer (Flutter) with over 5 years of experience
Project Overview
I built a full-featured E-Commerce App that allows users to:

View Products: Users can browse and view various products available in the store.
Add to Cart: Products can be added to the cart for later checkout.
Checkout: Users can proceed to checkout and complete their purchases.
Search for Products: Users can search for products, and search history is automatically recorded and displayed for convenience.

What I Did
To power the application, I built a custom backend using JavaScript (Node.js) with the following capabilities:

User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and reset their passwords.
Product Management: I fetched all products from the Fake Store API and populated them in my own database. This allowed me to have full control over the data, including functionalities such as adding items to the cart and checking them out.
Notifications: I implemented a notification system where users receive alerts whenever they add products to the cart and other relevant actions.
Search History: Users’ recent searches are automatically recorded, providing a convenient way to view past searches and refine future searches.
Challenges
I was given 4 days to complete the project, which posed a few challenges:

Backend Development: Creating my own custom backend to power the app took up a significant portion of the time.
Additional Features: Implementing additional features such as notifications and password reset functionality also required time investment.
While these challenges impacted my timeline, I aimed to deliver a comprehensive and functional application within the given constraints.

Conclusion
Despite the limited time, I was able to build a fully functional e-commerce application with several advanced features. This project demonstrates my expertise in Flutter and Node.js, as well as my ability to manage complex integrations within tight deadlines.
